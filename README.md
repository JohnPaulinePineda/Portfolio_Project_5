This [project](https://johnpaulinepineda.github.io/Portfolio_Project_5/) implements the survival analysis and descriptive modelling steps for a three-group right-censored data with time-independent variables using the Cox Proportional Hazards Model. The Kaplan-Meier Survival Curves and Log-Rank Test were applied during the differential analysis of the survival data between groups. All predictors' prognostic significance were individually and simultaneously evaluated using Univariate and Multivariate Cox Proportional Hazards Models, respectively. The discrimination power of the resulting models were assessed using the Harrel's Concordance Index. The final prognostic model was internally validated using Bootstrap Validation with Optimism Estimation and evaluated for compliance on all required model assumptions using the appropriate diagnostics.
